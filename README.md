## What this ships

This repo is a static Kinetic Gain evidence surface, not a placeholder page. It packages FirstUp signals into a board-readable operating view with decision workflow, board-pack copy, related links, and validation checks:

- Exposure: where workflow, platform, or communications risk can become visible.
- Savings: where duplicate effort, drift, or manual coordination can be reduced.
- Investment: which next action deserves funding, ownership, or escalation.
- Story: how the evidence should be explained to executives or investors.

## Operating workflow

1. Ingest current platform signals, ownership notes, exception records, and timing windows.
2. Score exposure, savings, and investment pressure separately.
3. Route every lane to one accountable owner, one audience, and one next action.
4. Brief the decision in language that can survive board, investor, or diligence review.
